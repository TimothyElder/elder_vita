My curriculum vitae.

Based on [Kieran Healy's](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita) CV. Praise be to him.

I use the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor which will soon be totally deprecated and unsupported, and the [atom-latex](https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex) package. Generating the PDF for my Vita includes toggling between several of the toolchains in Atom's package preferences.
